From infrastructure perspective we was using Kubernetes as orchestration of all services. Going through all the services I configured logs to send them to console in a unified format. Almost all the services was written in C#/.NET (.NET Core). From infrastructure perspective I configured logs path as following - fluent-bit -> fluentd -> (Logentries, AWS S3, Bugsnag, Elasticsearch). So, I started from fluent-bit (adding it to existing pods) to collect all the logs from services' console output and send them to fluentd. fluentd responsibility is to send logs to different kinds of targets based on filtering, like - all logs should be archived and stored in AWS S3, errors and warnings - to Elasticsearch, critical errors - to Bugsnag. While working with fluentd I had to write own filters using Ruby programming language that was really new for me. During this period I was working with DevOps Engineer closely learning from him a lot of stuff related to Kubernetes (starting from deploying Kubernetes to AWS using kops from scratch, configuring it and finishing with monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Grafana).",

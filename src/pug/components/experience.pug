                h5 Description:
                p Continue working on HPE ALM product until Mar, 2017. I was involved in different parts of a product - ALM frontend and backend, its Administration tool that is written in Delphi, ALM SaaS Add-on that was developed for those customers who don't want to buy On Premise application but just to use ALM as a service for certain period of time. ALM has 3 major releases (from 11.00 and till 14.00 versions included) during these 5.5 years in HPE. On Mar, 2017 HPE becomes a part of Microfocus company and it closes a lot of its departments in different parts of the world including Ukraine. So, at this point I become a part of another product - Prysm iPhone App (please find it in "Portfolio" for more details).
                p For 1 year I was an off-shore contractor for Prysm Inc. on Prysm iPhone App product using C#/.NET + Xamarin. As in previous product I work here in fully Agile environment, collaborating with QA teams, Project Manager, DevOps team, Design team, etc. One of the most interesting tasks for me was to make a change in Google Chrome project - make Cookies saving not locally (in SQLite) but to shared storage (Redis in my case). To have a possibility to share cookies between different Chrome instances.

                p After Prysm Inc. decided to close some QA and engineering departments in Ukraine including team where I was working I became an off-shore contractor for Earnin company in Microservices team (May, 2018 - Sep, 2018). Here I worked 50/50 as a DevOps engineer and Software Engineer.
                p I was responsible for Logs feature. The aim was to collect all the logs from all the services and send them to multiple targets. From infrastructure perspective we was using Kubernetes as orchestration of all services. Going through all the services I configured logs to send them to console in a unified format. Almost all the services was written in C#/.NET (.NET Core). From infrastructure perspective I configured logs path as following - fluent-bit -> fluentd -> (Logentries, AWS S3, Bugsnag, Elasticsearch). So, I started from fluent-bit (adding it to existing pods) to collect all the logs from services' console output and send them to fluentd. fluentd responsibility is to send logs to different kinds of targets based on filtering, like - all logs should be archived and stored in AWS S3, errors and upper - to Bugsnag, etc. While working with fluentd I had to write own filters using Ruby programming language that was really new for me. During this period I was working with DevOps Engineer closely learning from him a lot of stuff related to Kubernetes (starting from deploying Kubernetes to AWS using kops from the scratch, configuring it and finishing with monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Grafana).

                p Still continue working for Hewlett Packard Enterprise but switching to "Application Lifecycle Management" product. Also, starting from this point I start learning Java (Spring) as it was the main language on Backend side. Here almost 90% I worked as a Backend Developer and sometimes had some Frontend tasks as well. In addition to previous scope of work I have to implement new features and writing technical and functional specifications prior to implementing them. In 2015 almost half of a year I was leading a side product called "ALM Robot". This product is a "helper" for ALM (please find it in "Portfolio" for more details). Backend is still in Java and frontend is written using AngularJS. So, at this time web frontend layer becomes more closer to me.
